Welcome to Healthy Kids Zone Survey App

Community Health Councils (CHC) would like to work with the CSCI577 class to develop a mobile application to map and assess physical assets and detriments to health as part of our initiative to reduce rates of obesity and hypertension in South Los Angeles. 

This application will be a part of the REACH demonstration project designed to be replicated on a national scale. This app should focus on our target area in South Los Angeles while maintaining the potential to launch in other cities and be administered by different organizations.
